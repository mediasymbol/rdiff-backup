# Description
This is a dockerized rdiff-backup application for automated backups. It can be used as server and as client in push and pull scenarios as well.

It wasn't meant to be used as a standalone container, but rather in combination with [mediasymbol/rdiff-backup-tool](https://github.com/mediasymbol/rdiff-backup-tool).

There you'll find all necessary information.
